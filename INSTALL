1. INSTALLATION

export MPI_DIR=<path to mpi installation>
run ./scripts/skv_install -i <SKV_DIR>

to install the most relevant files and example configuration for SKV.




2. RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT

2.1 prerequisites and dependencies

 Installation and setup of the following is not covered here:

  * any MPI runtime env to start the server (and parallel clients if
    applicable)

  * SoftIWarp (siw) if you plan to run server and clients on
    overlapping sets of nodes

  * an OFED-RDMA capable network and setup (alternative siw)

2.2 SKV runtime

 * skv_server.conf: this file contains important configuration
   information for server AND client.  There are 2 options for the
   file:

   * either a global config under /etc/skv_server.conf
   * of a per-user config under ${HOME}/.skv_server.conf

   the skv_install script installs an example copy as
   <SKV_DIR>/etc/skv_server.conf The file contains descriptions of
   each setting and should be self-explaining

 * running the server:

   * a single server can be run by just executing
     <SKV_DIR>/bin/SKVServer. If you want a parallel server you need
     to use your preferred MPI program launcher to kick it off. For
     example:
   
        mpiexec -n 8 -f /etc/machinefile <SKV_DIR>/bin/SKVServer

   * if everything works fine, you'll not get back a prompt. You'll
     see an SKVServer process running and /tmp/ (as of the defaults in
     skv_server.conf) will contain several skv_files as described
     below

 * skv server files:

   * skv_server.info; skv_machinefile: the file contains a list of IP
     addresses and port numbers indicating how to connect to the
     server on THIS particular node.  Each server instance replaces
     its entry with the loopback address and can be reached via a
     proper siw installation.

   * beef.slab: is the mmapped file that contains the stored
     data. Currently, all storage memory has to be pinned and thus the
     capacity per node is limited by the amount of available memory
     and the memlock limit of the user (see ulimit -l and
     /etc/security/limits...)

   * *.FxLog logfiles of the server. Currently, each server instance
      logs the connections. This can be changed via the make.conf file
      in the base directory of the SKV distribution by commenting
      in/out the *_LOG lines.



 * skv client:

   * a client requires the skv_server.conf file in one of the places
     described above and a server machinefile to learn about the
     location of the servers.  Since the server creates this file,
     there's no manual intervention required if a client runs on a
     node that has a server too.  However, if the client runs on a
     distinct set of nodes, this file has to be created manually.  (or
     by copying one of the server-created files and replace the lines
     that have the loopback address with the proper IP address.

   * clients can be either MPI or non-MPI programs.  Depending on
     which library and compiler was used to create the executable.
